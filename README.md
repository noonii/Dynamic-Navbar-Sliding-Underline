# Dynamic-Navbar-Sliding-Underline
  
  When you hover over the menu's in the navbar, it will have a sliding underline dynamically resize and reposition based on the size of the &lt;li> tag.
  
  For simplicities sake, I only included the hover feature here. If you want both hover & click, visit the codepen!
